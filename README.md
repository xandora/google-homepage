# Google Homepage Project

## Introduction
This is the first mini-project handed out by The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). It is designed to put in practise the basic HTML and CSS skills that are taught in the Web Developer 101 course.

There should be a mix of HTML and CSS, with particular technologies like Grid, Flexbox, and Media Queries used to make the site responsive.
